I am an Assistant Professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

During undergraduate years, I had the valuable opportunity to study both mathematics and physics at Tsinghua University. Guided by [Liang Kong](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/liangkong.html), I entered the realm of category theory and my fundamental philosophy was converted ever since: **It is all about morphisms.**
For a physicist, morphisms may be replaced for physical probes, measurements or observations. An object, such as an _electron_, is an illusion born from all the probes upon it.
In precise mathematical language, this is the [Yoneda Lemma](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma), an elementary but deep and central result in category theory

My PhD research later at Perimeter Institute, under the supervision of [Xiao-Gang Wen](https://xgwen.mit.edu/), focused on the interplay between symmetry and topological order. I then moved to Institute for Quantum Computing as a Postdoctoral researcher and completed the works on the [classification of 3+1D topological orders [I]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.021074)[[II]](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.021005). Recently, I am pursing a comprehensive higher categorical formulation for generalized symmetry and topological defects.
